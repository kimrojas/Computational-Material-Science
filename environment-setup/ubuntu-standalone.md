# Ubuntu ISO image

Download Ubuntu ISO image from its [website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

At the time of writing, the latest ubuntu release is *ubuntu-20.04.1*

> Note: <br> Other flavors of Ubuntu are available that provides a more lightweight variant (for shitty PCs, jk) or a more glorified desktop interface (Mac OS-like)


# Virtual Machine software

Download [VMware workstation player](https://www.vmware.com/asean/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html), version 15.5 as of the time of writing. 

For this guide, I will be using VMware which has a similar process to a hardware install as well.   

>There are three choices for VM software: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [VMware workstation player](https://www.vmware.com/asean/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html), and Microsoft Hyper-V. A comparison can be seen [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/virtualbox-vs-vmware-vs-hyper-v/)
>
>- VirtualBox is free but slow
>- Hyper-V is complicated to use and is slow
>- VMware workstation player is limited to 1 VM at a time but is fast.
