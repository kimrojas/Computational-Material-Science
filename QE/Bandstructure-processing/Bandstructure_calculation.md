## Band Structure Calculation

This is a step-by-step guide in doing a band structure calculation.
**Required:**
 - Quantum espresso (serial/parallel)
 - XCRYSDEN
 - matplotlib

### Relaxation
For this guide, I used MoS2. The input file for relaxation is in the relaxation folder. I also added comments on the input file.

1. Make sure you have your desired structure. You can use xcrysden to view the structure of the atoms on your input.
2. Run ``pw.x -in mos2_0_relax.in > mos2_0_relax.out `` .
